== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Isn't this the same as using the Private status? =

Actually, no, they are not the same thing.

The Private status is a special kind of published status. It means the content is only available to certain logged in users, generally authors (own posts), editors, and administrators.

The Logged in post status, on the other hand, is available to all logged in users, whatever their role.

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Logged In Post Status, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-logged-in-post-status/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-logged-in-post-status/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.

= What if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?  =
